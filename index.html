<p>Zen Laboratories humbly presents a remake of KScript (originally created by Master4523 and Ardivaba for KAG Classic), with a slightly different approach, compatible with Beta.</p>

<p>If you ever wanted to have global ranking system, ingame currency, complete RPG system, special items available only for certain players and personal storages for them, KScript2 is here to help.</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Easily extendable parsing system</li>
    <li>Handy services to help you</li>
    <li>Example mods, which perform common tasks + Knight RPG Demo</li>
    <li>Clever system of configuration</li>
</ul>
<h2>Idea:</h2>

<p>KScript2 follows the same idea as the original KScript - parsing the RCON output and writing to it.</p>
<p>You can easily extend parsing system to define your own game events, coming from vanilla kag or your own mods.</p>
<p>Then you can perform ANY task on your server be it saving/reading to/from external database, requesting weather from the Internet, or just posting a message to your IRC channel.</p>
<p>Finally you can either respond to server with your own custom code or make use of handy mods, which do it for you!.</p>
<p>The entire behavior of KScript2 is defined in mods.</p>

</ul>


<h2>Stability:</h2>

<p>KScript2 was battle tested on Black Death Servers. The entire global ranking system is done using this utility.</p>

<h2>Roadmap:</h2>

<p>A few helpful mods are already there. Now we will be focusing on documentation, adding new mods, examples and bugfixes. If the concept survives, we will move to more advanced examples and mods.</p>
<p>You can report bugs and request common mods in the issues section.</p>
<p>Feel free to post any ideas as well! :)</p>
