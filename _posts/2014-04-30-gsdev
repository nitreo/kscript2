title: KScript2 for coders
---

This is a guide to how you can utilize KScript2.

As a developer you are going to write mods. In fact, KScript2 is barely dependent on kag.
The entire behavior is defined in mods.

*What a single mod can do?*

    - Communicate with server using RCON
    - Parse messages from server
    - Emit events for other mods
    - React to events from other mods
    - Anything else

Some mods can parse server messages and emit events.
Others can react to events and send some data to server.
Anyway, you have the power of NodeJS and tons of modules for it to achieve any goal.

*Core:*
By default there are 6 objects that are available from any mod:

 - RCON
 - GameEvents
 - Parser
 - Logger
 - Config
 - Dao
